# Data Directory

This directory will contain the scraped data output files.

## Expected file formats:
- CSV files for tabular data
- JSON files for structured data
- Raw HTML files (if needed for debugging)
- Processed data files

## Note:
Add `.gitkeep` or specific files to version control as needed.
Large data files should be added to `.gitignore`.
